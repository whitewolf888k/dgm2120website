    <div class="the-beginning" >
         <h2>The Beginning</h2>
     <p>Before the Crystal became dark it was called the Crystal of Truth and was the heart of the planet Thra. The Crystal created a being called Aughra to be a Mediator for the plant life of Thra.</p>
         <h2>The First Great Conjunction</h2>
     <p>At The First Great Conjunction (when the three suns of Thra line up) beings called urSkeks came to the planet Thra through the Crystal of Truth. They had been banished from their own realm. They created a castle to house the Crystal as well as themselves. Some of Thra's inhabitants were not happy with these new beings but Aughra was able to bring about peace.</p>
         <h2>The Second Great Conjunction: The Great Division</h2>
     <p>The urSkeks wanted to return to their native home. They beleive they could use the Crystal during the Second Great Conjunction to rid themselves of their darker side and be purified, which they believe would then allow them to return home. As the urSkeks stood surrounding the Crystal, one gave into its dark nature which caused a chain reaction. The urSkeks split into two different beings; the Skeksis (which were dark and twisted) and the urRu (who were gentle and peaceful). Confusion and chaos ensued and one of the Skeksis attacked the Crystal resulting in a shard to fly off.</p>
         <h2>Skeksis Reign</h2>
     <p>The Skeksis took control soon after The Second Great Conjunction and declared themselve "lords" of the now-fractured Crystal. They were at first benevolent in their rule but soon became corrupt. They began fearing for their own mortality. They tried to find new ways to become immortal. Using the Crystal and the Suns of Thra they were able to rejuvinate themselves for a time but it did not have the desired effect that they longed for. They soon found that they could drain living essence from the inhabanits of Thra, specifically the Gelfings.</p>
         <h2>Age of Resistance</h2>
     <p>As the Skeksis started to take Gelfings and drain them of their essence, a group of Gelflings formed a resistance to fight back. (This is when <i>The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance</i> takes place.) Also, around this time a prophecy was declared that stated that a Gelfling would end Skeksis rule and bring peace to Thra by healing the fractured Crystal. Try as they might, the Gelflings could not overcome the Skeksis and soon were all captured and distroyed except for two.</p>
         <h2>The Third Great Conjunction: The Journey of Jen</h2>
     <p>After all the Gelflings had been distoryed the Skeksis soon turned to Podlings to drain them of their essences but it was not as effective as using Gelfings. The Skeksis knew that another conjunction was coming. They planned to use it and the Crystal to immortalize themselves. About the same time, the urRu happened to save one Gelfling and named him Jen. The urRu knew Jen was the Gelfling from the prophcey who would heal the Crystal and save Thra. As time went on one of the urRu lay dying and told Jen that he needed to find the Crystal shard at the home of Aughra. (This is when <i>The Dark Crystal</i> takes place.)</p>
